Since last summer I have been working on a new definition for
[Anime and Cartoon using Artificial Intelligence](https://medium.com/@Dawars/kibu-lift-anime-or-cartoon-a1d2310b4659).

During this time I took part in the KiBu Lift Program and the Hungarian National Talent Program.

The Demo Day marked the end of the program where I presented the result of my work.

Along with the presentation I released the first public beta of the app which you can try out here: [dawars.me/anime/](https://dawars.me/anime/)

## How does it work



## Future work

Currently the app does a good job at recognising and distinguishing between anime and cartoon images.

We still don't know however what's the base of its judgement.

I'm planning to teach an even bigger Neural Network these images which is known for its performance in Style Transfer.
And with this we could tell the network to modify an image to look a lot like the other category.
This way we could get a glimpse into the inner workings of the network.

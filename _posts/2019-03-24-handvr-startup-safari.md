<p>During the last 6 month I have been working on <a href="https://dawars.me/personalized-hands" target="_blank">HandVR</a>, a personalized VR experience.</p>
<p>At the end of the 6 month Lift program at KiBu I had the opportunity to present the results at Startup Safari.</p>

<p>In this demo the user has photo realistic hand models instead of seeing the controllers.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>There are 10 sliders corresponding to the 10 most significant principal components (<a href="https://dawars.me%/mano" target="_blank">dawars.me/mano</a>) responsible for properties like size, thickness all the way to small changes that are difficult to describe in words.<br>By changing these sliders, the hand models update in real time.</p>

<p>The users really liked that they can experience having different hand shapes. It made them understand how having different anatomy influences simple everyday tasks.</p>

After OnePlus announced it would give out free VR headsets for their product launch, the first 30.000 units were almost instantly sold out.

I wasn&#8217;t aware of that when I first read about it on their Facebook page. It wasn&#8217;t obvious what they meant by a &#8220;free VR headset&#8221; and I was disappointed by the lack of proper Android updates so I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to it. (I believed it was free _if _I pre-ordered  the OnePlus 3)

When I realized my mistake, it was long over. Fortunately for me I reverse engineered the link which indicates the availability of the headset and I looked at it just at the right moment for the second round.

## Packaging

I received mine this morning just two days before the product launch. I was really worried it wouldn&#8217;t make it in time.

Although the box was  a little damaged during shipment, its look lived up to my expectations. Similar to my OnePlus 2 packaging it has a beautiful simplistic design.

Unboxing and assembly was straightforward and very easy. They attached a manual with images of the necessary steps and download links to the companion app (which I didn&#8217;t try yet).

They even included a _lens cleaning cloth _which is a nice touch since these lenses collect dust very easily in general.

## The headset

OnePlus teamed up with the VR specialists <a href="http://antvr.eu/" target="_blank">AntVR</a> to build this limited edition VR headset.

The launch event will be held at a virtual space station called the Loop, for more information click <a href="https://oneplus.net/hu/loop" target="_blank">here</a>.

Much like the _Samsung Gear VR_, the OnePlus Loop has a head mount and accepts any 5″ to 6″ phones as a display. There is also an option to change the distance of the lenses but not much.

I used my OnePlus 2 device for testing.

As a test I downloaded and watched their previous product launch. Ironically while watching the video I got distracted by a couple of things they said but didn&#8217;t quite match my experiences with the phone.

<img class="alignright" src="//www.hypergridbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/AntVR-QR-Code-qr_viewer_profile.png" />The headset can be used with any other <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=virtual%20reality&c=apps&hl=en" target="_blank">Virtual Reality app</a>, but if you do that, you&#8217;ll need this (unofficial) Qr code for configuration.

Apart from that here are a few things to note:

  * It is very comfortable to wear, except at the nose part, where there is no foam. It presses my nose a little too hard but I think I can get used to it.
  * The loop itself has a gorgeous design and a sturdy build. It&#8217;s a lot more massive than a cheap Google Cardboard which given the production cost is no surprise.
  * The lenses are good, it gives a clean and crispy image with my phones&#8217; display. (<del>the pixels are still visible which I generally dislike about VR</del> never mind)
  * The only real disadvantage is the lack of a button which is probably not needed for the lauch event but it makes it practically impossible to play any games with it. (A workaround is to use a Bluetooth controller)

## Final words

I had a very good experience with The OnePlus Loop. It has premium build quality as one would expect from this company and it&#8217;s comfortable to wear for longer periods of time.

In spite of all that I wouldn&#8217;t buy the OnePlus 3 however good it may be since I already have a OnePlus 2, the supposedly &#8220;2016 Flagship Killer&#8221;. But the headset itself will give me the opportunity to view the launch in high quality which will be without a doubt spectacular.

However for me its best use will be the ability to develop VR content for phones.
